Software Development Life Cycle documents using Scrum-agile approach


-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  I interpret user needs by focusing on the program I am modifying or building on. After I know its funtcionality, I can then determine the users needs by the programs impediments. Whether it be missing organization or easy to look at UI, figuring out what a user wants becomes simplier as you undertsand that program first. To put it simpler to answer the users needs, is the user wants to perform some task so that they may achieve some goal. Creating a user story helps seperate what objectives, attributes and difficulty level the user's story is requiring. Developing the users value statment is going to be the final objective the user wants and the acceptence criteria is going to be the steps the user will be able to do suit the needs. 

-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I will be approaching my future programs with a Test Driven Development mindset. This means that I will need to understand the requirements of the program and the complete outcome. Creating a test case for my program first before starting to develop the code will aid me in reducing errors that can come from developing without knowing what the result is first. I want to incorporate creating user stories, product backlog and a retrospective. These scrum artifacts will help me in refining my code and communcation throughout my team. Going in with a communication and collaboration first mindset will grant everyone the ability to be on the same page as well as clear up any concerns that may come about.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  To me, what it means to be a good team member in software development is to collaborate effectively, communicate accordingly to what the topic at hand is and to express any concerns I have about the project or task. Becoming transparent with your team will be the best tool you can lean on when it comes to working with a tight knit group of individuals. Pair programming will also help with communicating your mind and seeing it apply in real time on a computer, sometimes what we say in our heads and how we translate that into our computer is not the same for how others understand. Practicing pair programming will help eliminate certain vocabulary that you may use for youself and help you communicate in an efective manner that is well receptive to your team.
